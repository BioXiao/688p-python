CBMG 688P case study: 3'UTR motif analysis
Keith Hughitt
2013/12/11

Overview
--------
This script brings together some of the concepts we have discussed in class
up to this point to complete a fairly complex and useful task: scanning a
genome to look for for interesting 3'UTR motifs 

The script expects a genome sequence (as a FASTA file), gene annotations (GFF),
and a simple CSV file containing a list of short DNA or RNA motifs that should
be searched for. The lines in the GFF file corresponding to genes are extracted
and an approximate 3'UTR location is determine by grabbing the next N (where N
is something like 500) bases after the coding sequence of the gene. The 3'UTR
sequence for each gene is retrieved from the FASTA file, and then each scanned
for the presence of each motif in the input list. The matches for each gene
are then printed to the screen.

Currently, the script has been hard-coded to look for Genome and annotation
data related to an organism that we work on in my lab (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi).
This was done primarily for convenience since I am more familiar with this
data. The organism has been sequenced, and the ~65 Megabase haploid sequence 
along with some annotation data are available at http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/.

The script assumes that the 3'UTR boundaries have not been well-defined, and
attempts to make a guess by taking a region of a specified length following
the each CDS. This, of course, is not perfect and is only meant for the
demonstrative purposes in this course. A better approach would be to attempt
to use existing 3'UTR information or make a more sophisticated guess at the
3'UTR location based on other properties of the surrounding sequence, etc.

Design Strategy
---------------
Basic process to follow when designing a script such as this one:

    1) Define our goals for the script -- what do we want it to do? What
       should the inputs and outputs be?
    2) Break up task into modular tasks: e.g. "load genome", "compute 3'UTR
       coordinates", etc.
    3) Decide how to store things internally: using lists? dicts? classes? etc.
    4) Code each part of the process, testing along the way; use the IPython
       console to inspect the values of each variable and make sure they are
       as you expect.
    5) Validate output.

Homework
--------
For homework, your goal will be to take this scripts, and improve it by
implementing one or more of the following changes:

1. Dynamic input

Using the argpase module discussed in class, add one or more command-line
parameters to allow the user to dynamically control how the script is executed.
Parameters to consider including:

    -g --input-genome
    -a --input-annotations
    -u --utr-length
    -c --chromosome

    OUTPUT_FILE: positional argument; see next section on CSV output

    Example usage:

    python utf_motif_analysis.py -g input.fasta -a input.gff -u 650 output.csv

2. CSV output

Currently, the script prints the results to the screen in the form:

    gene_id: motif1, motif2, etc...

This is not a very useful format, however, for further analysis. A better
approach would be to store the output as a CSV file. Using the csv.writer class
(http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html), write the results of this script
as a CSV file where the first column is the gene id and each column there
after contains motif found for that gene. Note that in this format the
number of columns will vary for each gene.

3. Alternative targets

Extend the script to support scanning alternative portions of the gene for
the input motifs, for example, the 5'UTR or the CDS.

4. Input UTR location

Instead of approximating the 3'UTR, allow the user to input the exact 3'UTR
locations by providing an addition file with entries of the following format:

    gene_id,start,end

Example:

    Tc00.1047053398345.10, 518916, 519456
